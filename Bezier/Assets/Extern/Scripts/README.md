Create and modify splines path directly inside Unity Editor. Just attach a Bezier Spline component to any GameObject.
You add and remove points by selecting curves extents (dark blue points) and pressing corresponding buttons in the inspector gui.

Based on Jasper Flick tutorial about splines (http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/curves-and-splines/)
